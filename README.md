## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to offset an image. I tried doing it without looking for solutions on google and I've made it (I don't know if it's a plausible way or if I just complicated something easier).

### Continued development

I should definitely start using sass and probably BEM (I was getting crazy trying to find name for classes).
